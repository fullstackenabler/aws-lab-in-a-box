# StrongDM Lab in a Box for AWS
> [!Warning]
> While we will attempt to keep tagged versions "working", there are a lot of improvements being shipped.
> Update with caution :)

This repository contains a set of modules that enable the user to deploy a quick lab to evaluate StrongDM capabilities, including
- An optional VPC, Subnet, Security Groups, NAT and Internet Gateway sets
- A StrongDM Gateway and a relay with an instance profile allowing them to use AWS secrets manager
- An SSH Target using StrongDM's CA for Authentication
- An RDS PostgreSQL target, using an autogenerated secret stored in AWS Secrets Manager for access
- AWS Read Only access on Both CLI and Console
- A Windows domain controller 
- A Windows server target using certificate authentication
- An EKS Cluster 

All resources are tagged according to variables set in the module, in order to set adequate access roles in StrongDM

## Prerequisites
In addition to the usual access credentials for AWS, the modules require an access key to StrongDM with the following privileges:

 ![StrongDM Permissions](doc/strongdm-permissions.png?raw=true)

Export the environment variables

```bash
export SDM_API_ACCESS_KEY=auth-aaabbbbcccccc
export SDM_API_SECRET_KEY=jksafhlksdhfsahgghdslkhaslghasdlkghlasdkhglkshg
```
or in Powershell
```powershell
$env:SDM_API_ACCESS_KEY="auth-xxxxxx888x8x88x8x6"
$env:SDM_API_SECRET_KEY="X4fasfasfasfasfasfsafaaqED34ge5343CkQ"
```

> [!NOTE]
> If your control plane is in the UK, or the EU, make sure that the SDM_HOST_API variable is correctly set.
> Gateways and relays *will* use this variable as well to register against the right tenant

```bash
export SDM_API_HOST=api.uk.strongdm.com:443
```
or in Powershell
```powershell
$env:SDM_API_HOST="api.uk.strongdm.com:443"
```

> [!NOTE]
> The verification of the operating system is done based on the presence of "c:" in the module path. If there is no c:,
> the module will not assume you're using Windows.

Make sure you're logged into sdm with 
```sdm login```
specially if you're using the Windows CA target, as it will use the local process to pull the Windows CA Certificate

## Variables
- Network
  - vpc: Id of an existing VPC. If it's null a new VPC will be created. If this variable is provided all of the related network variables will be required
  - gateway_subnet: ID of a Public Subnet
  - relay_subnet(-b,-c): Private subnets to deploy resources
  - private_sg: Id of the Security group for private machines (reachable by the relay)
  - public_sg: ID of the public security group
The module will not verify if the right network configuration is set so make sure to refer to the SDM [Ports Guide](https://www.strongdm.com/docs/admin/deployment/ports-guide/)

- Resources
  - create_linux_target: Create a linux target resource with ssh ca authentication
  - create_rds_postgresql: Create an RDS Postgresql database using password authentication, retrieving credentials from secrets manager
  - create_eks: Create a Kubernetes Cluster
  - create_domain_controller: Create a Windows Domain Controller
  - create_windows_target: Create a Windows RDP target
  - create_aws_ro: Create a Role that can be assumed by the gateway to access AWS
 
- Other Variables:
  - tagset: tags to apply to all resources
  - name: an arbitrary string that will be added to all resource names


You can reference the [terraform.tfvars.example](main/terraform.tfvars.example) file in the main module for reference

## Getting started

Within the main module, do the usual steps

```bash
cd main
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply
``` 
If you're running this in Windows you may have to set your execution policy accordingly as the script will run some local Powershell to retrieve the CA certificate

```powershell
set-executionpolicy bypass
```
## Windows Target Warnings
Setting up a Domain controller takes several reboots. This is implemented by a persistent Powershell script that runs at each reboot and has flow control through creating some "flag files" in c:\ with the "done" extension as each step is completed. You can reference the full Powershell script [here](dc/install-dc.ps1.tpl).

This means that of cource that you cannot deploy the "Windows target" until the domain controller is up and running
